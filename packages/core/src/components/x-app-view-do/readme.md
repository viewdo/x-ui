# X-APP-DO

The **`<x-app-view-do>`** element represents a specialized child-route that for its parent [**`<x-app-view>`**](/components/x-app-view) route. It represents a sub-route that has special presentation and workflow behaviors.

> **`<x-app-view-do>`** are essentially **to-do** items for the parent route.

They are used to create presentation, wizards, input workflows, or step by step instructions or wherever you want guided or automatic navigation. These are the only routes that support [audio](/audio), [video](/video) and [declarative actions](/actions).

## Usage

Much like its parent, [**`<x-app-view>`**](/components/x-app-view), basic routing information is required.

```html
<x-app-view ...>
  <x-app-view-do
    url="<sub-path>"
    page-title="<route title>"
    display="page|modal|full"
    visit="always|once|optional"
    when="<expression predicate>"
    content-src="<remote html"
    transition="<animation-enter>"
    scroll-top-offset=""
    next-after="<seconds before next>"
  >
    ...
  </x-app-view-do>
  ...
</x-app-view>
```

> The **when** attribute is a data-expression to that overrides the **visit** strategy. It is a predicate that produces a boolean result. **true: visit=always** false: visit=optional

### How it works

When the parent [**`<x-app-view>`**](/components/x-app-view)'s route is activated, before rendering, it:

1. Lists all direct-child **`<x-app-view-do>`** items, one at a time in sequence.
2. Finds the first unvisited route respecting the **'visit'** requirement or [**'when'** predicate](/expression), if present.

   * **If found**: It pushes the page state to its url, thus activated the child route.
   * **Otherwise**: The [**`<x-app-view>`**](/components/x-app-view) is satisfied and can now render its own contents.

## Samples

The following are some examples to demonstrate how you can combine the settings to create robust workflows.

### Present Once

This route will be activated once for each new visit to the page. (Visit 'once' is the default behavior, so it can be omitted.)

```html
<x-app-view-do url="/accept-terms" page-title="Consent" visit="once"> ... </x-app-view-do>
```

> By default, the visit-strategy is 'once'. In this case, the visit is stored in local-storage. Any subsequent visits to this page with the same browser won't see it again.

### Present Each Visit

This route will be activated once for each new session visit to the page.

```html
<x-app-view-do url="/accept-terms" page-title="Consent" visit="always"> ... </x-app-view-do>
```

> For **'always'**, the visit is stored in local-session which is destroyed when the browser tab is closed, but retained while on the site.

### Collect Required Data

This route will be activated if a value for 'consent' was not found in local-storage[^1].

```html
<x-app-view-do url="/accept-terms" page-title="Consent" when="!{storage:consent}"> ... </x-app-view-do>
```

> **Important**: If a value for `{storage:consent}` is not set in this route's somehow, the user cannot get to the parent page.

This data can be set manually or using our specialized declarative components to update data. See [declarative actions](/actions) for more info.

[^1]: Check out the [data system](/embedded-data) for expressions and how to use external data.

### Optional

This route will be activated only through navigation. This is helpful for opt-in presentations, modals or other action-based content.

```html
<x-app-view-do url="/learn-more" page-title="Watch a video" visit="optional"> ... </x-app-view-do>
```

> **Important**: When linking from a **`<x-app-view-do>`** to another any other route, you using a **`<x-app-link>`**, validation and visit tracking is not performed. To mark the current route 'visited', add a **'x-next'** attribute to any clickable element.

### Routing & Guided Navigation

This evaluation has to take place before the route is activated as the underlying data can change in the previous Do components. If the component is deemed unnecessary (the predicate returns false), the component marks itself ‘complete’ and returns control to the parent view, without revealing its contents.

### Child Attribute Detection & Resolution

The following attributes are queried to resolve certain data-values or show/hide conditions for all child elements.

#### Special Next & Back Attributes

To make guided-navigation easy, you can add attributes to set-up event-handlers for next & back.

#### [x-next]

```html
<any x-next />
or
<any x-next="route" />
```

#### [x-back]

```html
<any x-back />
```

#### [x-hide-when]

For each child element with this attribute, the value of the attribute is evaluated for a predicate – and if TRUE, the element is hidden. This evaluation occurs whenever data-changes.

```html
<any x-hide-when="predicate" />
```

#### [x-show-when]

For each child element with this attribute, the value of the attribute is evaluated for a predicate – and if FALSE, the element is shown. This evaluation occurs whenever data-changes.

```html
<any x-show-when="predicate" hidden />
```

> To initially hide the element, be sure to include the ‘hidden’ attribute.

#### Conditioned Classes: [x-class-when] && [x-class]

This pair of attributes conditionally toggle the class specified in the `x-class` attribute using the `x-class-where` expression.

```html
<any x-class="class" x-class-when="predicate"></any>
```

#### Value From: [x-value-from]

Input-type elements (input, textarea and select) can specify a data expression for its value. This informs the route container to update this value when it changes.

```html
<any x-class="class" x-class-when="predicate"></any>
```

### Time-Presentation Child Attribute Resolution

The [**`<x-app-view-do>`**](/components/x-app-view-do) element is always keeping track of time once its route is active. As such, you can create timed-based actions using special attributes placed on any child element.

> ℹ️) If a video element is detected, its time is used, allowing pause & play.

#### [x-in-time] & [x-in-class]

This attribute removes the 'hidden' attribute if present at the specified time in seconds.

```html
<any hidden x-in-time="1" />
```

> To initially hide the element, be sure to include the ‘hidden’ attribute.

When used with x-in-class, this attribute adds the specified class and removes the 'hidden' attribute if present at the specified time in seconds.

```html
<any hidden x-in-time="1" x-in-class="fade-in" />
```

#### [x-out-time] & [x-out-class]

This attribute adds the 'hidden' attribute if no x-out-class attribute is present at the specified time in seconds.

```html
<any x-out-time="1" />
```

> ℹ️) To initially hide the element, be sure to include the ‘hidden’ attribute.

When used with x-out-class, this attribute adds the specified class and removes the 'hidden' attribute if present at the specified time out seconds.

```html
<any x-out-time="1" x-out-class="fade-out" />
```

#### Time To: [x-time-to]

This attribute instructs [**`<x-app-view-do>`**](/components/x-app-view-do) to inject the current time to the named attributes. In this example's case 'value' will be updated.

```html
<any value="" x-time-to="value" />
```

#### Time Percentage To: [x-percentage-to]

This attribute instructs [**`<x-app-view-do>`**](/components/x-app-view-do) to inject the current time percentage (based on the **next-after** attribute or the video-duration) to the named attributes. In this example's case 'value' will be updated.

```html
<any value="" x-percentage-to="value" />
```
