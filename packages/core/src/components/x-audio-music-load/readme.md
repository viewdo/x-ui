# X-AUDIO-LOAD-MUSIC

This component declares audio used within this [\<x-app-view-do\>](/components/x-app-view-do) route. The [\<x-audio-music-load\>](/components/x-audio-music-load) represents audio files and play behaviors. They are sent to the audio player to pre-load or play when the route is active. The player manages them according to their settings.

## Usage

```html
<x-app-view-do>
  <x-audio-music-load
    mode='play|load'
    track-id='<unique-id>'
    src='<url>'
    discard='route|video|next|none'
    loop
    track
  ></x-audio-music-load>
</x-app-view-do>
```

### Simple

```html
<x-app-view-do>
  <x-audio-music-load 
    track-id='<unique-id>' 
    src='<url>'>
  </x-audio-music-load>
</x-app-view-do>
```

```html
<x-app-view-do>
  <x-audio-music-load
    mode='queue' 
    id='<unique-id>' 
    src='<url>' 
    discard='none' 
    loop>
  </x-audio-music-load>
</x-app-view-do>
```

#### Mode

- **queue**: (default) plays after the previous audio is complete or when it's requested.
- **play**: stop any playing audio and play now, buffering be-damned.
- **wait**: wait for an action before playing, any currently playing audio continues.

#### Discard

- video: when any video plays (default for sound)
- state: state changes
- event: wait for a stop event (or any other activation)
- none: loop until stopped or updated by new state (default for music)

#### Track

If audio has replay set to true, re-entry to the originating state will re-activate the audio if the previous audio has been deactivated. The default is false.
