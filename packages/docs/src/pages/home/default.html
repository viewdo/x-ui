<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
  <b class="brand">&lt;x-ui/&gt;</b> is a set of custom HTML elements (web
  components). They enrich static HTML files with features typically only
  available with JavaScript framework. Our focus is on creating experiential
  websites without script or a build-process.
</p>
<h2>What it is not.</h2>
<p>
  <b class="brand">&lt;x-ui/&gt;</b> experience elements add functionality, NOT
  design. These elements work <em>with</em> your design. Since it is HTML, you
  can always use it with any framework, component library or UI kit you want.
</p>
<h3>No Framework Necessary</h3>
<p> The elements bring time-saving techniques like shared-layouts, reusable
  widgets, URL-based routing, lazy-loading, data-binding, rule-based workflows,
  way-finding, markdown, and much more, directly in HTML. </p>
