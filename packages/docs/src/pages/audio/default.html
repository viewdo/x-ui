  <h1>Reactive Audio</h1>
  <p class="lead">Reactive audio to accompany pages, actions, events or anything else you can dream up.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-3">How it works</h2>
  <p>
    The audio player component is a set of two HTML Audio players designed to allow two layers of sound to play during
    an experience. There is both a music and a sound layer for audio timed with the experience through route-changes and
    declarative actions.
  </p>
  <h4>Music</h4>
  <p>
    The <strong>Music</strong> layer is meant to play background sounds or music. It should never hold audio with
    singing, talking, or any annoying sounds. These clips can loop.
  </p>
  <h4>Sound</h4>
  <p>
    The <strong>Sound</strong> layer is meant for short clips. The sound layer should never have music or background
    sounds.
  </p>

  <h2>Enable Audio</h2>
  <p>
    To enable audio, you must first add the
    <a href="/components/x-audio-player"><b>&lt;x-audio-player&gt;</b> </a> to the page.
  </p>

  <x-content-markdown>
    <script type="text/markdown">
      ```html
      <x-audio-player title="Audio" display> </x-audio-player>
      ```
    </script>
  </x-content-markdown>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Audio Rules:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Many files can be configured and pre-loaded for each player.</li>
    <li>Only one audio file can be playing per layer at a time.</li>
    <li>Only the music audio can loop.</li>
    <li>Looping audio loops until its deactivation event.</li>
    <li>
      If audio is set to loop with no deactivation, any new configuration will end it. For instance, if new audio is
      configured to activate in a queued fashion, the looping audio should stop and allowing the queued audio to play
      when it ends.
    </li>
    <li>Hard deactivations ease out the audio with a .5 second fade-out before playing the next clip.</li>
    <li>Queued audio that doesn't get a chance to play before the next state change is removed from the queue.</li>
  </ul>
