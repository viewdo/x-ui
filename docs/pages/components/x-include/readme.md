# X-INCLUDE

This component fetches remote HTML and renders it safely and directly into the page when when and where you tell it too, as soon as it renders.

## Usage

```html
<x-include src="<url-to-html>"> </x-include>
```

### Delayed Rendering

When using this component, you may want to delay the fetch until the content is needed. The **no-render** attribute will prevent the HTML from being fetched until that attribute is removed.

```html
<x-include id="include" src="<url-to-html>" no-render> </x-include>
```

You can remove the attribute programmatically to force the fetch:

```javascript
const include = document.querySelector("#include);
include.removeAttribute('no-render');
```

Or, just include it in one of the components [**`<x-view>`**](/components/x-view) or [**`<x-view-do>`**](/components/x-view-do). These components remove any **no-render** attributes on child elements once their route is activated, giving us lazy-loaded routes with this component.
